# Title: Analyze gender differences and seasonal changes in negative emotion expression
# Abstract
A growing body of evidence shows that people with depression use language differently. Many studies have unveiled a class of words that can help accurately predict whether someone is suffering from depression. The most robust language marker of depression is the frequency of using first-person singular pronouns, such as I and my. Moreover, specific negative descriptors are linked to the tendency of depression.

Under this context, we have applied sentiment analysis to automatically sort text data from Quotebank by positive, negative, and neutral sentiments. The further goals of our project are (1) Analyzing the correlation between the frequency of using negative words and seasons (2) Analyzing the change in the number of negative words each year, and identifying whether the growing number of negative words is related to significant events by date. For example, if we can identify more negative words in 2020 due to the occurrence of COVID-19.

# Research Questions
As the dataset of Quotebank contains data from 2015 to 2020, which enables us to perform statistical analysis along the period, we would like to take advantage of this to analyze the time expansion property. We will focus on analyzing the relationship between the amounts of the language markers and the effects of change of season and significant events. The detailed questions are as follows:

It is only until recently that people started to be more and more aware of mental condition. Therefore, we are going to figure out if there is a growing attention to mental condition in society as the disorder prevails by the following keywords: mental illness, psychopath, depression, mental disorder.
Can we see a growing population affected by depression with our text-based detection method in accordance with the statistical results?
Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD) is a form of depression that occurs in fall and winter due to the decrease of sunlight while recover when spring and summer hit again. We will discuss the effect by looking into the difference between the four seasons.
Apart from SAD, January is known as the most depressing month of the year. As a result of the due dates of credit card bills are usually January, people find themselves overwhelmed by the economics pressure. We will investigate this phenomenon, especially compared with other winter months.
The major events that occurred would also affect peopleâ€™s emotion. Therefore, we will analyze the impact of these events comparing the data before and after given a certain period, depends on the lasting time of the event, such as COVID-19 pandemic.
